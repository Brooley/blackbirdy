<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>I</h3>

		Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
		The only moving thing<br>
		Was the eye of the blackbird.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>II</h3>

		I was of three minds,<br>
		Like a tree<br>
		In which there are three blackbirds.<br>
</section>


<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>III</h3>

		The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br>
		It was a small part of the pantomime.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>IV</h3>

		A man and a woman<br>
		Are one.<br>
		A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
		Are one.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>V</h3>

		I do not know which to prefer,<br>
		The beauty of inflections<br>
		Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br>
		The blackbird whistling<br>
		Or just after.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>VI</h3>

		Icicles filled the long window<br>
		With barbaric glass.<br>
		The shadow of the blackbird<br>
		Crossed it, to and fro.<br>
		The mood<br>
		Traced in the shadow<br>
		An indecipherable cause.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>VII</h3>

		O thin men of Haddam,<br>
		Why do you imagine golden birds?<br>
		Do you not see how the blackbird<br>
		Walks around the feet<br>
		Of the women about you?<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>VIII</h3>

		I know noble accents<br>
		And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br>
		But I know, too,<br>
		That the blackbird is involved<br>
		In what I know.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>IX</h3>

		When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br>
		It marked the edge<br>
		Of one of many circles.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>X</h3>

		At the sight of blackbirds<br>
		Flying in a green light,<br>
		Even the bawds of euphony<br>
		Would cry out sharply.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>XI</h3>

		He rode over Connecticut<br>
		In a glass coach.<br>
		Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
		In that he mistook<br>
		The shadow of his equipage<br>
		For blackbirds.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>XII</h3>

		The river is moving.<br>
		The blackbird must be flying.<br>
</section>

<section  class="stanza">
	<h3>XIII</h3>

		It was evening all afternoon.<br>
		It was snowing<br>
		And it was going to snow.<br>
		The blackbird sat<br>
		In the cedar-limbs.<br>
